# Project: BiIt

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), along with the redux template.

In this project, I developed a frontend web application, catalogue of financial values using [Stock API](https://api.coingecko.com/en/api) and insert the data to my React/Redux Application.
